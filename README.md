# Insta-Tool
Insta-Tool is a tool written in Python using the instaloader library to get informations about your and others instragram accounts.
In order to access Instagram data it uses Firefox cookies so you just need to login to your account using Firefox and you don't need to provide any information to thirds.

To use the program correctly I suggest to maintain the executable and all the other .txt files that the program will generate in a folder on your desktop.

You will find all the instructions once you run the program.
I hope you will find this tool useful!
